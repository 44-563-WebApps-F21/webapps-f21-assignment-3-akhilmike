    <h2>String Processing</h2>
    <blockquote>The thesis describes extensive studies on various algorithms for efficient string processing. Data available in/via computers are often of enormous size, and thus, it is significantly important and necessary to invent timeand space-efficient methods to process them. Most of such data are, in fact, stored and manipulated as strings. String matching is most fundamental in string processing, where the problem is to examine whether or not a pattern string p occurs in a text string w. There are two cases to consider; p is fixed and w is flexible, and vise versa. In the former case, it is adequate to employ the noble algorithm by Knuth, Morris, and Pratt that solves the problem in O(|w|) time using O(|p|) space.</blockquote>
